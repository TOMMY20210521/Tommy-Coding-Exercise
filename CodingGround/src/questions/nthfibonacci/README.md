## Question <!--Question Descriptions-->
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is `0`, the second number is `1`, and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as `FO = 0` and `F1 = 1`. For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is `FO`; therefore, `getNthFib(1)` is equal to `FO` , `getNthFib(2)` is equal to `F1`, etc..

### Sample Input #1
```java
n = 2
```
### Sample Output #1
```java
1 // 0, 1
```
### Sample Input #2
```java
n = 6
```
### Sample Output #2
```java
5 // 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
```

```java
import java.util.*;

class Program {
  public static int getNthFib(int n) {
    // Write your code here.
    return -1;
  }
}
