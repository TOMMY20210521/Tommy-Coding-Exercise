## Question <!--Question Descriptions-->
Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters and returns the index of the string's first non-repeating character.

The first non-repeating character is the first character in a string that occurs only once.

If the input string doesn't have any non-repeating characters, your function should return `-1`

### Sample Input
```java
string = "abcdcaf"
```
### Sample Output
```java
1 // The first non-repeating character is "b" and is found at index 1.
```
## Skeleton <!--Skeleton Code Provided-->
```java
import java.util.*;

class Program {

  public int firstNonRepeatingCharacter(String string) {
    // Write your code here.
    return -1;
  }
}
```
